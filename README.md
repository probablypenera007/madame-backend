4. **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** For powerful and scalable cloud hosting.

5. **Security and Authorization:**
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Implementing JWT for secure user authentication and to maintain session integrity.
  - **Helmet:**  Utilizing Helmet to set various HTTP headers for app protection.
  - **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Enabling CORS to allow for secure and controlled access to the server resources from different domains.
  - **Joi & Celebrate:** Additional layers of data validation.

6. **Winston Logging:** Efficient error tracking and application monitoring.

7. **AI Model Integration:** Incorporates an advanced AI model for enhanced user interaction.
